When forming an LLC in Connecticut, checking the availability of your desired business name is crucial, as it must be distinguishable from existing entities registered in the state. To ensure compliance, the name must include "Limited Liability Company" or abbreviations like "LLC" or "L.L.C." Additionally, itâ€™s wise to avoid names that could mislead the public or suggest affiliation with government agencies. Conduct a name search through the Connecticut Secretary of State's online database to verify availability, and consider reserving the name for 120 days for a small fee if you need more time before filing your formation documents. Furthermore, itâ€™s important to check for trademark registrations at the federal level to avoid potential legal issues later on. Finally, securing a matching domain name can enhance your online presence and brand identity, so consider that when deciding on your LLC name.
